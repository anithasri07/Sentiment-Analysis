# Emotion Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

This project explores emotion classification for textual comments using classical NLP techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify text into emotions like **fear**, **anger**, and **joy** based on their content.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle: [Emotion Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdelrahmanemad594/emotion-classification-nlp-95-accuracy).

### Dataset Features:
- **Comment**: Statements or messages regarding specific events or situations.
- **Emotion**: Labels representing the emotion of the comment (e.g., fear ðŸ˜¨, anger ðŸ˜¡, joy ðŸ˜‚).

## Project Overview

The task involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning text by removing special characters and stop words.
   - Tokenization and lemmatization for structured text representation.
   
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Using techniques like **Bag of Words**, **n-grams**, and **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical vectors.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms for multi-class classification.
   - Models include **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machines**.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
